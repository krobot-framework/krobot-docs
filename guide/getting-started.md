# Getting Started

{% method %}  
  
## Setting up the project

First, we will set up a basic project. At first, you should know that there is two versions of Krobot. A JavaScript version, and a Java version. To swap the book between languages, **use the two buttons on the top right corner of the book.
**

 - The JavaScript version is based on **Discord.JS**
 - The Java version is based on **JDA**
 
In both case we will use a package manager, download the libraries manually would be too long and complicated.

You can use any editor/IDE then to open your project.

{% sample lang="js" %}

Let's create a simple project : Using NPM/Yarn, initialize a new project.

```bash
$ npm init
```

Then, add "[krobotjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/krobotjs "Krobot NPM package")" as dependency.

```bash
$ npm install krobotjs
```

You should probably create a start script and a src/ folder then :

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```

{% sample lang="java" %}

To use Krobot, you can use either Maven, or Gradle. In this guide i will use Gradle, but do what you prefer.

Let's create a simple project.  **Don't forget to add the Krobot maven repository, and JCenter**.

```bash
$ gradle init
```
```groovy
repositories {
  jcenter()  
  maven { url 'http://krobot-framework.github.io/maven/' }
}

dependencies {
  compile 'fr.litarvan.krobot:krobot-framework:2.1.2'
}
```

{% endmethod %}

## Registering the bot

Before anything, you need to go to [the Discord Developer Console](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me "Discord developer apps") to create an app.

Click on "New app", then enter a name, put an icon, and add a description. You don't need to fill the Redirect URIs. To then create the bot account, click on **"Create a Bot User"**. Finally, note your "Client ID" at the top, and the most important, the "Token" of the bot user (click on "Token: **click to reveal**" in the bot user section).

The bot token is the key to your app, so don't publish it anyway !

{% method %}

## Initializing the bot

Then, we're going to initialize the bot itself.

We will create the bot and login it using the bot token. **Again, I repeat, don't publish your bot token !**

I will not really learn you to use JDA or Discord.js, but you can always look at their documentations :

 - [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki "JDA documentation")
 - [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome "Discord.JS documentation")

You will need first to add your bot to a guild. The link should be like that :

```
https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=0
```

Obviously replace the "YOUR\_CLIENT\_ID" by the client ID that you had before. Using this link you can add your bot to discord guilds.


{% sample lang="js" %}

We will start by creating a Discord JS client :

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const bot = new Discord.Client();
```

This is the main API constant : The Discord Client. The start point of your bot.
We need then to provide the token :

```js
bot.login("Your token");
```

**Remember, this line should ALWAYS be at the end of your start script !**

To test our bot, let's log the messages :

```js
bot.on('message', message => console.log(message));
```

Start it, and it should display on the console, every message sent in the guild where he is.

{% sample lang="java" %}

At first, we create a class that implements Bot :

```java
public class MyBot implements IBot
{
    @Override
    public void init()
    {
        System.out.println("I am initializing");
    }
}
```

You need then, to start your bot, to ask Krobot to start it, like this :

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws LoginException, InterruptedException, RateLimitedException
{
    Krobot.start("Your bot token", MyBot.class);
}
```

Obviously, replace "Your bot token" with the bot token you had before.

You can now launch your bot, you should see a lot of logs, and your "I am initializing" in the middle of them.
